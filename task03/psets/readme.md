# This is the pset subfolder
Honestly,these pset's are hard. when I began I thought why have they divide it into weeks for just one lecture but when i tried to solve the psets is when I realised 
how much time it takes. The problem for me was understanding what the question meant. Once I could figure out the basic algorithm or what to do the coding part was easy
At the time of writing this i watched and solved till week 2. Will try to finish till week four along with other tasks.
