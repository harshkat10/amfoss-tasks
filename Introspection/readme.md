# Why must we choose you?
I have always been a tech enthusiast and am fascinated by coding. I chose computer maths in my 11th class without hesitation. I am eager to get started and work on projects 
to contribute to the world. I am hardworking and will try to solve any challenge that's thrown at me.

# What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next 6 months I am hoping to learn C and Java programs and hopefully contribute to projects using my knowledge of python.

# How would you contribute back to the club? 
I would help in any way possible. I will do whatever is asked from me by my seniors and mentors. Although I can't say I am expert coder right now, I will expand my knowledge and
help the club and the projects it undertakes.

# Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I think the selection proccess is an excellent way of choosing people. And I can't wait to do the tasks.
