#Why must we choose you?
I have always been a tech enthusiast, trying to know more about what is happening in the tech world. And to me coding has always been fascinating. Which is why i chose computer maths
in my 11th class without hesitation. I have dreams and hopes of one day becoming an avid coder and contributing to the tech world. I am a very passionate person and am hardworking.
I will give my 100% to solve any challenge that's thrown at me and will never give up.
#What is your plan for the next 6 months?
In the next 6 months i hope to be able to learn to code in c or java. In school we had python so i know the basics. But I have heard that java and C are also important languages to know.
So I will try to learn the basics of these languages and hopefully be fluent in them.
#How would you contribute back to the club? 
First of all i will do everything that is asked of from me without hesitation. I will make sure that i can be of help in any way possible. I am also a fast learner so i think i will be 
able to help my seniors with a little of their help. And i would also love to contribute to the various projects the club undergoes.
#Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
